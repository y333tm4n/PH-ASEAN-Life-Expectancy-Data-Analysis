## Life Expectancy Analysis 
## Overview
This repository contains a data analysis project that focuses on exploring and analyzing life expectancy data for selected countries in Southeast Asia. The project utilizes Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and other libraries to preprocess, visualize, and perform anomaly detection on the provided dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical life expectancy data for various countries. It includes information about life expectancy values for different years, as well as additional attributes such as ISO3 codes, country names, and more. The dataset serves as the foundation for the analysis and anomaly detection tasks.

## Project Goals
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded and preprocessed to extract relevant information, filter data for specific countries, and prepare it for further analysis.

Data Visualization: Visualizations are created using pandas and matplotlib to gain insights into the trends and patterns of life expectancy values over time. Line charts and heatmaps are used to visualize trends and anomalies.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Replace 'your_file.csv' in the code with the path to your dataset CSV file.
- Install the required libraries using pip install pandas numpy matplotlib.
- Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the analysis and anomaly detection.
- Explore the generated visualizations and insights.

## Additional Notes
This project is meant for educational purposes and to demonstrate data analysis techniques using Python.
Feel free to customize the code, extend the analysis, or use it as a starting point for your own projects.
